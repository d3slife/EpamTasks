# EpamTasks

This repository was initially created to successfully accomplish admission 'EPAM System's training task.

It includes several folders:
1st - contains *.java files;
2nd - compiled *.class files;
3rd - executable java archive file and a batch file, to make it even easier to run.

Also this repository contains a brief essay on inner aspirations of doing all this stuff =).
